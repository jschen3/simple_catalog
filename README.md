I adapted a coding challenge into this project to put on github. This catalog simply shows a pretty looking catalog and
what you can do with angular and some bootstrap css. This catalog also demonstrates some awesome angular structures. 
So it really showcasts an easy and elegant use of the model view controller framework.
